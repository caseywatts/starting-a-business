But it can help some!\n\n## A True Business Bank Account\nA business bank account is one registered to an EIN (Employer Identification Number). For example, I have a business account with Mercury for my company \"Happy and Effective LLC\" which has its own EIN.\n\nBefore I had my EIN I could NOT open a business bank account with Mercury (or any other bank) -- there was no formal business entity for the account to be owned by yet.\n\n## A Pseudo-Business Bank Account\nYou can create a pseudo-business bank account by having a separate checking account in your main bank, just to help keep things straight for tax time.\n\nWhen I was getting started, I just used a separate checking account \"bucket\" for my business money. In Ally (my personal bank) I nicknamed one account “Personal Checking” and one “Business Checking.”\n\nThis helped me keep income and expenses straight, like in Mint and Quickbooks. Quickbooks will even auto-tag things for certain accounts.\n\nBefore my business bank account was set up, I also set aside one of my personal credit cards to be used for business-only, to help with tracking expenses (in Quickbooks).\n\nYou can even set up regular transfers $x/month to simulate a \"paycheck\" for yourself.\n\n## Proving Income\nThe downside of pseudo-business bank accounts is that it's harder to prove \"income\" with these self-to-self transfers.\n\nPeople doing income verification (for renting, or buying a house, or taking out a loan for a car etc) expect to see transfers from a true business bank account to your personal account.\n\nIt's still possible to prove income without a business bank account! I'm still glad I didn't deal with the overhead of a business for a year or two, personally. \n\nI've managed to prove my income to rent a place by showing my bank statements with my clients' payments to me (those are from a business bank account! not just transfers from-me-to-me).\n\nI also added a spreadsheet to help make it clear (not sure if they read it really!).\n\n\n\nI don’t think there’s too much benefit to using an entirely separate bank for the sole proprietorship account - I just use the same one (Ally).

My first year I had ~30 services that I offered or got paid to do, or was considered for. It's dizzying to try and do too many, but I learned a lot about the market and about myself!\n\nEventually most people decide to offer fewer services to specialize in. This helps you with your own focus, but it has an even stronger effect for marketing. The more specific your services are, the easier it is for people to think of you when your services are needed -- and this includes  both potential clients directly and people who would connect you to those potential clients.\n\nAs my friend Andrea Goulet often says, \"the riches are in the niches\" (riches can rhyme with niches if you want it to! hah).\n\n### Starter Service\n\n-   Most places want to ‘try it before the buy it”\n    -   or more often try it (paid) before they buy a lot of it\n    -   this reduces the risk of buying a big expensive service\n-   What services can you over a small amount of that helps them see the value of more?\n    -   For me, workshops: a free workshop (granted to someone who attends a public workshop of mine, to take to their company)\n    -   For me, coaching: Coaching comes up in some way when I interview people through an Organizational Assessment — people who would want coaching often volunteer for this. I’m not explicitly coaching in these, but they can see my style, how I listen and validate and have insight (which I don’t take up too much time to share yet bc I’m busy listening first!)\n\n## Too Many Options?

It's best practice to set expectations clearly like this, especially for larger clients and longer engagements.\n\nSometimes I do skip a full contract! Like for one-off coaching clients who pay upfront for 3 sessions. In these cases expecttaions were still set pretty clearly! Booth in an onboarding doc and in a 15-min screening call.\n\nI try to do SOWs even for small things (an SOW is very short anyway! see below), but sometimes I might skip an SOW if it's a small amount of money and I already trust them (i.e. they've paid me on time before) -- like a 3-hour thing to help a past client.\n\nSome people might say that's bad practice, but it's always worked out for me so far when there's trust, and I only do it if I'm willing to eat the cost if things go wrong, too.\n\n## Types of Formal Documents\nProposal\nMSA\nSOW\nInvoice\n\n\n# Marketing / Sales\n\n## Untargeted marketing\n\nwebsite\n\n## Individual-targeted marketing\n\nemail to (the decision maker at the company for your service; eg the CTO or the HR training person) with what they might need\n\n## \"Pre-posal\"\n\n“here’s what you said you need”\n\n“here’s what makes me uniquely equipped to help”\n\n“here’s how I can help”\n\nemailed + attached\n\n## Proposal\n\nsimilar to the pre-posal, but with prices?\n\n(idk why Andrea doesn’t call the pre-posal a proposal, all the clients seem to lol)\n\n# Expectation Setting / Legal\n\n## Expectations for Relationship\n\nMSA Contract — contains late payment details etc\n\n## Expectations for Current Work\n\nSOW Contract\n\nFirst SOW gets sent out with the MSA, same doc\n\n# Money Terms\n\n## Estimate\n\nballpark amount, pending info about detail\n\ncould be a range\n\ne.g. “It depends on the size of your org, or whether I do surveys”\n\ncould be in the Pre-posal/Proposal\n\n## Quote\n\nspecific amount that won’t change for this specific, defined work\n\nscope changes could trigger a change still of course\n\ncould be a fixed amount, or could be a rate\n\ncould be in the Pre-posal/Proposal\n\n## Invoice\n\n= bill; you owe me this much today, a specific amount\n\none SOW could have multiple invoices (e.g. if it’s monthly)\n\nshould be attached to a SOW (current work expectations doc)\n\n# Examples\n\n## Brian’s Design Work\n\n-   Marketing Artifacts\n    -   Introduction = existing relationship; no need for the marketing artifacts\n    -   Agreement = requested something by email; reply with yes I can help\n-   Expectation Setting Artifacts\n    -   Relationship Expectations = implied\n    -   Current Work Expectations = by email / implied\n-   Payment Artifacts\n    -   Expectation Setting = Quote\n    -   Billing = Invoice\n\n## Casey’s Usual Flow\n\n-   Marketing Artifacts\n    -   Introduction: opening with the targeted marketing to HR etc; linking to the website\n    -   Agreement: Pre-posal “here’s what you said you need”\n-   Expectation Setting Artifacts\n    -   Relationship Expectations = MSA\n    -   Current Work Expectations = SOW\n-   Payment Artifacts\n    -   Expectation Setting = Estimate in pre-posal\n    -   Billing = Invoice, paid upfront, tied to SOW\n\n\n## After Formal Paperwork\nAfter we agree to the formal paperwork, you can work on [Getting Paid + Invoicing](Getting%20Paid%20+%20Invoicing.md)","lastmodified":"2023-02-20T23:01:11.885775642Z","tags":null},"/Freelance-Communities":{"title":"","content":"* Happy and Effective Community Discord\n\t* private to workshop attendees\n\t* If you can see this private site, you can join the private Discord!\n\t* If you have trouble getting in, ask Casey\n* Tech-oriented Ones\n\t* [Rands' Leadership Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/) #consulting \n\t* [DCTechSlack.com](DCTechSlack.com) #freelancing\n* DC area Ones\n\t* [DCTechSlack.com](DCTechSlack.com) #freelancing\n\t* [FreelanceDC](https://www.freelancedc.org/) (Slack/Facebook)","lastmodified":"2023-02-20T23:01:11.885775642Z","tags":null},"/Getting-Clients":{"title":"Getting Clients","content":"\n### For someone to buy your service, they go through phases\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n\tAware --\u003e Interested --\u003e Desire --\u003e Action\n```\n\nAIDA\n\nAware = Are they aware of your service?\n\nInterest = Are they interested?

Where are they?\n\nFor tech employees as an example\n\nSocial media: Often on Twitter or LinkedIn.\n\nOnline communities: Slack/Discord\n\nIn person events: They’re also at [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) events and conferences!\n\n### How to get people into the funnel?\n\nYou don’t have to use all of these, choose your strengths:\n\nsocial media\n\nreferrals\n\nnetworking\n\nevents\n\netc\n\n### Connections\n\nMost people start with connections!\n\n-   your connections hiring you directly\n-   your connections’ companies hiring you\n-   your connections’ connections hiring you\n-   your connections’ connections’ companies hiring you\n\n### How to get people through the funnel?\n\nOnce you have a “lead”\n\nSales call techniques - listening, SPIN selling\n\npeople are immensely more likely to buy something to meet an explicit need they have - one they express explicitly\n\n### Getting Started Is Tough\n\nWhat can you say when someone ask “who have you worked with?” but you’re just getting started?? 😬\n\nusually what they really want to know is “why should I believe you can do this?”.\n\nsometimes they mean “what sectors have you worked in? my sector is not like the others!” (like: private companies, government, consulting firms, nonprofits etc)\n\n### Credibility\n\nEventually you can say “I have been paid to do this through my own company, here are past clients”\n\nIn the meantime it’s okay to list places you’ve done related work with, even if it was before the inception of this company. You _do_ have a lot of experience, and it counts!\n\nyou probably have past _experience_ you can leverage.\n\n### What if they find out I’m an imposter?\n\nIf you got the client, how confident are you that you could help with their problems?\n\nThink of people you’ve worked with who you were not impressed with — you’re probably even above average! If you’re just starting, you care a lot and have a lot to prove. I’m confident in you, even if I don’t know you.\n\nSometimes my partner shares a horror story from a past company, and I love the way he punctuates them — he says “anyone can run a business!”\n\nThat’s... true! You can, too :)\n\n### I want some initial clients\n\nIf not, or if you want more, you could do a client or two for cheaper or free. You could volunteer for a nonprofit in exchange for using them as case studies you share.\n\nBeware not to let this trend continue for long though — you need less credibility like this than you might imagine. A lot of your success depends on your sales techniques.\n\n## Lead Generation\n\nI love doing public, free, community events anyway - I’ve been doing these for 10y!\n\nThese also happen to generate business leads for me lately. Event hosts are very generous at encouraging me to share my business materials, even when I’m shy to — they want quality content, and I’m a professional at that!\n\n### building credibility\n\nif you can — show, don’t tell\n\ndo invest in people who “get it” already — strong allies\n\n### Trust\n\nhighest = own experience\n\nnext = experience of someone trusted (friend, coworker)\n\nnext = experience of someone kinda trusted (respected companies; certifications)\n\nnext = experience of someone not trusted (strangers on the internet)\n\nlowest = what the salesperson says themselves\n\n### Why connections are so powerful\n\nfriends, past coworkers, professional contacts\n\nthey have the highest level of trust (their own, direct experience)\n\nthey often have the 2nd level of trust (someone trusted) for a decision maker\n\n### Competitive Analysis — How is the customer making their decisions?\n\nWhat 3-6 factors are they considering? Which are more/less important? You can ask them that!\n\nWhat factors are the most important? How would they rank them?\n\nWhen someone is comfortable thinking in numbers, sometimes I ask them to say “double or half (or average)” for each of them.\n\nKnowing this can help you know what to focus on with them\n\nThis can also help you decide how to strengthen your company and/or marketing materials, too!\n\n[an example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18XikuteJR7cPnThLNzT7rkj1_pAFJ2UHpX8z2LdpL0o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Questions are more powerful than statements\n\n“From what you’ve seen, what would you say the strengths are of my company?”\n\n“I’m stronger than competitors because REASONS”\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nI’m not sure about asking about weaknesses/concerns/hesitations directly — could move their focus somewhere you don’t want them to focus\n\nbut it’s probably good to address any glaring ones upfront, or be ready to address them","lastmodified":"2023-02-20T23:01:11.885775642Z","tags":null},"/Getting-Paid-+-Invoicing":{"title":"","content":"For the first two years I would bill clients as a sole proprietor, and money goes directly to my personal bank account. Lately I'm working on billing them as my LLC, and it'll go to my business bank account (Mercury) and THEN I'll eventually \"pay myself\" by transferring it to my personal account (no paystubs or anything).\n\n## Before Invoicing\nBefore invoicing a client I usually do the [Formal Paperwork](Formal%20Paperwork.md)  -- MSA, SOW, agree to rates.\n\n## Invoice\nAn invoice can be as simple as an email. I like them to be a PDF at least with some basic formatting (but it's not required).\n\nNote: If you do this in Google Docs, don't do `cmd+p` to print, instead do `File → Export to → PDF` -- that'll have the correct title!\n\nI use Stripe to send Invoices lately. It generates a PDF for me. They only get a cut if the client uses credit card (I usually turn that off -- most big clients pay by ACH/Check anyway)\n\n## Sharing SSN/EIN with the company\nSome companies also ask for my SSN/EIN so they can give me a W-9 at the end of the year (but it doesn’t matter to me if they do). I’ve been using SSN for the past two years since I didn’t get set up with an EIN until this LLC (and that’s okay!)\n\nIf a company doesn’t deal with W-9 that’s okay and I’m still responsible for taxes on it (Quickbooks tracks this income) — I don’t really care if they deal with it or not, personally.\n\n## Invoice Payment\nThey might pay me in one of several ways:\n1. ACH. Often they pay via the Stripe invoice (ACH)\n2. Check. Sometimes they send me a check (by mail or digitally and I have to print it), and then I deposit it manually.\n3. Third-party. sometimes they pay online another way (bill.com, and I have it connected to my bank account)\n\nI don't have to worry about this upfront -- I just send them the invoice, and they come back and ask \"can I pay you using X?\" and I usually just say yes to whatever it is.  \n\n## Payment Link / Sliding Scale\nFor some services (like [career coaching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qat3-ghzTQPWqIywitsfegXFcod_BNOlkLvNAYmb8O8/edit?usp=sharing)) I use a sliding scale + Stripe's payment link feature. I want to help people who need it, even if they are making less money. I can't let all of my clients be on the lower end, so I soft-cap it (just by tracking that in my head).\n\nI do payments for these through Stripe using coupon codes (check out the doc to see how I do it).\n\nFor individuals paying me, I let them use credit card and I eat the fee (most individual people / non-businesses aren't used to paying ACH, and it's not wotrh it to me to teach them to do ti)\n\nIf someone wants a larger package of services (like 6+ sessions), then I'll usually invoice them instead (like above), as opposed to using Stripe payment link.\n\n(Stripe payments + coupon codes IS multiple steps though, and I wish I could simplify it for clients -- someday!)\n\n---\nI bill them as a sole proprietor, and money goes directly to my personal bank account (through Stripe’s intermediary one if they do ACH).\n\nI send an Invoice (via Stripe) — it can be as simple as an email, although I like them to be PDF at least like Stripe does\n\nThen they pay Stripe’s ACH or they send me a check\n\nI deposit it in my personal account\n\nBefore invoicing them I usually get them to sign a contract (MSA/SOW) with rates\n\nSometimes I skip a contract if it’s small and/or I trust them — like my one off coaching clients who pay upfront anyway)\n\nSome companies also ask for my SSN/EIN so they can give me a W-9 at the end of the year (but it doesn’t matter to me if they do).

If your group has a set budget already, I can tailor things I offer to fit that budget.\n    \n2.  If your group doesn't have a budget, then I can calculate price on my end. To calculate it, I need to know what we'd want to do ideally — we can talk through that together!\n    \n\n### Relative Importance of Cost/Budget\n\nNot every client is equally concerned about budget\n\n-   Two big factors are\n    -   impact (can you do the work you promise? will it have the effect we want?)\n    -   budget (how much will it cost?)\n-   Size of company\n    -   Companies tend to be less concerned about cost than individuals (my money vs someone else’s money)\n    -   Larger companies tend to be less concerned about cost (more about: can I justify it to the right people?)\n-   Individual motivations\n    -   What motivates [this specific person who will decide to buy or not]?\n        -   Motivated more by impact than cost savings? They may be seen as the person who brought in the help to solve this big problem!\n        -   Motivated more by cost savings than impact? They may just have to “cover their bases” — may be more focused on the highest value (impact divided by cost).\n-   Multiple Budgets\n    -   Many departments have their own budget — like:\n        -   Each Engineering Manager may have a training budget\n        -   HR may have a training budget for DEI training\n        -   an ERG (employee resource group) may have its own budget\n        -   Individuals may have their own training budget\n    -   Any of these can potentially ask for more budget if it’s motivated enough (and not every buyer realizes this power)\n\n### Price Factors\n\nI don’t always share the nuances of how I calculate price with customers, but some are curious.\n\nSome things that increase price:\n\n-   my expertise in something\n    -   could be that I’ve done it before\n    -   could be that I can do it well anyway\n-   more client-hours\n-   more audience members (for talks/workshops)\n-   custom work (my expertise + more non-client-hours)\n    -   outcome is more important than polish overall\n-   more non-client-hours (prep work; research; writing/documenting)\n-   Intellectual Property — agree to let them record it (they can own the performance, but not my content)\n\nSome things that decrease price:\n\n-   bulk discounts (more services / more people included in services)\n-   guaranteed testimonials (but you can get testimonials anyway!)\n-   guaranteed feedback from them (but you can get feedback anyway!)\n-   agree to recommend me to colleagues\n-   association — agree to let me reference your company\n-   agree to let me share anonymized content?\n\nSome things that don’t affect price\n\n-   existing content (my expertise + it’s polished content)\n    -   good for me that I can re-use it! That doesn’t affect them though\n\n### 5 C’s of Compensation\n\nAndrea’s 5 C’s\n\n-   Explicit\n    -   Cash\n    -   Connections — can they introduce me to new people? do they have a robust network?\n        -   “introduce me to 3 CTOs”\n    -   Content — Is it public? Is it recorded — can I put it on a speaker reel? Is this a talk I want to develop? Beta testing it. Ask for feedback? Can I re-use this work?\n-   Implicit\n    -   Credibility — prestige of association\n    -   Community — pro bono, doing good stuff want to help, meaning and impact\n\nExamples\n\n-   talk given before — just cash\n-   Me EIT volunteering — community support, credibility of cofounder of the group, connections to leads, content development — not volunteering bc I get 4/5 of the C’s\n\nIf they’re low on cash\n\n-   Would I feel good doing this anyway? (community impact)\n-   Would it be recorded and I own the performance?\n-   Can this person introduce me to people?\n-   If org agrees to (buy in bulk) to bring me in for others — I’ll toss this in for free\n    -   eg “if you commit to 5 I’ll do a 2nd free one”\n    -   could be for women’s group but open to anyone\n-   Public community event, hosted/sponsored by company (advertising/marketing budget)\n\n### the power of discounts\n\nminor discounts incentivize choices - when they’re on the fence (often!) people tend to go for the discount\n\nbulk discounts - buy 10 sessions, get a discount % on them\n\nupsell discounts - buy service x, and get some of service y too\n\n\n### Pricing Techniques\n\nI don’t have an easy answer, but I have an approach you might like to use here! “Racheting”\n\n## Racheting\nI HAVE set my cost too high before and lots clients by following the common advice “charge more.” Usually I’d rather have these clients for sure for now and build out my portfolio and references and network — and getting to my goal price is a secondary goal.I call this technique “ratcheting,” like the tool that tightens in one direction.Ratcheting is basically raising my price for each client so I can learn the boundaries. My goal price is in the range (“sweet spot”) between “client hesitates but does pay” and “client declines.” (sometimes I can turn a decline around somehow, but that’s a different story).I “ratchet” up the price until I have a sense of where the upper limit is for a certain type of client. This upper limit varies by industry, by size of company etc — I try to keep those factors in mind too.\n\nIf you’re starting out with a new service or new type of client you could “bootstrap” this search in the price-space by trying out different rates with different clients and seeing reactions — like 200/h, 250/h, 300/h, 350/h etc.\n\nThis is searching the space of what they’ll pay, as opposed to what you would like to get paid. It’s totally useful to know what you want to get paid too! But it doesn’t necessarily inform you of what clients will pay\n\n## Rule of Thumb\nI’ve heard a rule of thumb that a freelancer rate is in the ballpark of some number multiplied by your base rate — x2 seems low to me, maybe it was x2.5 or x3 even?\n\nAlthough I think that piece of advice is really to shift your mindset more than an actual “based-on-data what-people-will-pay” sort of thing.\n\n## Commodity vs Specialty\nAnother big difference in pricing is if you’re doing a “commodity” service (easy to find an alternative) or a “specialty” service (hard/impossible to find an equivalent alternative). Specialty services can charge a lot more than commodity services. Specialization is powerful, and a lot of advice focuses on that -- but that doesn’t mean that offering a commodity service isn’t a valid option. Most services are probably more of a commodity!\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-20T23:01:11.88977573Z","tags":null},"/Taxes-and-Legal-Structures":{"title":"Legal Structures and Taxes","content":"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice; I am not your financial advisor. These are my opinions and how I approach things (and also often common opinions from lots of freelancers I know!)\n\n\n### I need an LLC, right? (no, not necessarily!)\nA lot of people think they MUST form an LLC to do side jobs. That's not true!\n\nYou can already get paid for work you do even without an LLC -- you are by default considered a \"**sole proprietor**\".\n\nIn fact, even some LLCs are considered a sole proprietorship still (\"LLC taxed as a sole proprietor\") if the finances aren't separated out fully. There are a lot of criteria to meet for your LLC to be a truly separate entity, to protect your personal finances (separate bank accounts with separate SSN/EIN numbers associated, clients clearly hire your company and not the individual person, the business pays you regularly as an employee (maybe with bonuses sure, but something). And that isn't all! I'm not an expert at this since I haven't done it yet myself.\n\nThe courts make the final determination. The true determination of whether your LLC is a separate entity (and therefore reduces your liability) lies with the courts if/when you end up with a case. And the evaluation varies court by court. (I lost the reference I had for this -- let me know if you find a good one on this!)\n\nForming an LLC is one ingredient for reducing, but not the only one.\n\nYou might be like me -- you might like to be a sole proprietor for a bit to try things out, and only take on low-risk, low-amount contracts for a while to feel it out. If eventually you feel like continuing on longer term, and taking larger, higher-risk, longer-term contracts THEN you should definitely consider these other structures.\n\n### How can I reduce my liability then??\nThese are my favorite three approaches, in order\n* Lower-risk contracts.\n\t* But practically -- if you are just dipping your toes in the water and doing small low-risk contracts with people you know and trust well, and you aren't even sure if you want to do this longer-term at a larger scale -- you might not want to worry about it for a bit! \n* Business insurance!\n\t* You might also want business insurance! And in many situations it may provide more protections than an LLC (especially if it's really just you).\n\t* In fact, some clients may require you have this anyway.\n\t* Professional Liability (\"Errors and Omissions\") is the most common kind I've heard of being used/required -- there are many more types as well\n\t* The most commonly used/recommended company for business insurance (in the US) is [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.com/small-business-insurance)\n* Keeping a clear distinction between yourself and your company as an entity (LLC)\n\t* Forming an LLC and separating the finances to a business bank account, and keeping a clear distinction can reduce your liability\n\n## Learning More\nMy favorite place to learn more about these is [the YouTube channel \"All Up In Yo' Business with Attorney Aiden Durham\"](https://www.youtube.com/@allupinyobiz)\n\nAny of these less-formal sources will cite and reference all of the legal sources (IRS.gov etc) -- it just really helps to have things organized in terms of what YOU are wondering / looking into in the moment (which irs.gov does NOT do so well lol)\n\n\n### Legal/Organizational Structures\n\ntodo: Differences between Sole Proprietorship, LLC, S-Corp etc\n\n### Filing Taxes + Deductions\n\nI use Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed to track expenses and manage my quarterly tax payments\n\nI use CreditKarma Tax (free) to file taxes each year\n\nYou must pay taxes throughout the year.\n* For traditionally-employed people, the company usually does deductions from your paycheck.\n* For self-employed people, you have to file [quarterly estimated taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes).\n\nWhat are these taxes? [Self-employment taxes and medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes) --\n* ~15% self-employment + ~15% medicare ends up being close to the ~30% that you're probably used to (of coures it varies by income level, but)\n\n#### How do I remember to pay quarterly taxes? When do I pay them?\nMake a recurring calendar event! \nThe dates are listed here:\nhttps://www.irs.gov/payments/pay-as-you-go-so-you-wont-owe-a-guide-to-withholding-estimated-taxes-and-ways-to-avoid-the-estimated-tax-penalty\nAs of 2023 they are:\n- April 15\n- June 15\n- September 15\n- January 15\n\nMost people pay either:\n* Online: https://www.irs.gov/payments\n* By Mail: mailing in a check (Quickbooks will generate a stub for you)\n\n### How do I calculate my estimated taxes?\nWhat if I don't know how much I'll make this year??\n\nTo calculate my estimated taxes, I just pay whatever Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed tells me to pay.\n\n### Deductions\n\nDeductions for business equipment (laptops etc) and software and travel and food etc happens on the [1040 Section C](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sc.pdf).\n\nQuickbooks Self-Employed is how I keep track of these -- it knows the IRS's ~20 categories AND a bunch of common ones that go into \"other\", and it can generate the table of amounts you'll need for the Schedule C come tax time.\n\nThere is also this other deduction QBIR: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/qualified-business-income-deduction\n\n\n### CRM\n\nHubspot\n\n[Sean’s powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gmcvJvoFWbHItCn1f3fmyZ6GNMKEolVb9wQypZrp_Hg/edit#slide=id.g24abaf8d29_0_91)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-20T23:01:11.88977573Z","tags":null},"/Tools":{"title":"Tools","content":"\nNotion, Quickbooks, Google Business, Stripe Invoicing, Stripe Atlas, Mercury Bank, Obsidian, Reclaim.ai, Calendly, Mailtrack.io, Whereby, Teachable, Gumroad, Etsy, Printful, Namecheap, super.so, webflow, Lu.ma, [ko-fi.com](http://ko-fi.com/), Google Analytics, Hotjar, Affinity Designer, Descript\n\n  \n\nI use Notion (it’s like Google docs + a database) to track time worked and to track leads/deals, and to track individuals (like a CRM)\n\nI use Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed to track expenses and taxes\n\nI use Google for Business for my business email and Google docs\n\nI use Stripe Invoicing to send [invoices](Invoicing%20Clients.md) (usually locked down to ACH only, so I don’t lose a ton on credit card fees - and half my clients send e-checks anyway and that’s fine too)\n[Invoicing Clients](Invoicing%20Clients.md)\n\nI registered my business with Stripe Atlas - I was in a big hurry so I’m thankful for it.
