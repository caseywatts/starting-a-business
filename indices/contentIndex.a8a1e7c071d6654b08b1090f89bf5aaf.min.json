My first year I had ~30 services that I offered or got paid to do, or was considered for. It's dizzying to try and do too many, but I learned a lot about the market and about myself!\n\nEventually most people decide to offer fewer services to specialize in. This helps you with your own focus, but it has an even stronger effect for marketing. The more specific your services are, the easier it is for people to think of you when your services are needed -- and this includes  both potential clients directly and people who would connect you to those potential clients.\n\nAs my friend Andrea Goulet often says, \"the riches are in the niches\" (riches rhymes with niches if you force it! hah).\n\n### Starter Service\n\n-   Most places want to ‚Äòtry it before the buy it‚Äù\n    -   or more often try it (paid) before they buy a lot of it\n    -   this reduces the risk of buying a big expensive service\n-   What services can you over a small amount of that helps them see the value of more?\n    -   For me, workshops: a free workshop (granted to someone who attends a public workshop of mine, to take to their company)\n    -   For me, coaching: Coaching comes up in some way when I interview people through an Organizational Assessment ‚Äî people who would want coaching often volunteer for this.

If your group has a set budget already, I can tailor things I offer to fit that budget.\n    \n2.  If your group doesn't have a budget, then I can calculate price on my end. To calculate it, I need to know what we'd want to do ideally ‚Äî we can talk through that together!\n    \n\n### Relative Importance of Cost/Budget\n\nNot every client is equally concerned about budget\n\n-   Two big factors are\n    -   impact (can you do the work you promise? will it have the effect we want?)\n    -   budget (how much will it cost?)\n-   Size of company\n    -   Companies tend to be less concerned about cost than individuals (my money vs someone else‚Äôs money)\n    -   Larger companies tend to be less concerned about cost (more about: can I justify it to the right people?)\n-   Individual motivations\n    -   What motivates [this specific person who will decide to buy or not]?\n        -   Motivated more by impact than cost savings? They may be seen as the person who brought in the help to solve this big problem!\n        -   Motivated more by cost savings than impact? They may just have to ‚Äúcover their bases‚Äù ‚Äî may be more focused on the highest value (impact divided by cost).\n-   Multiple Budgets\n    -   Many departments have their own budget ‚Äî like:\n        -   Each Engineering Manager may have a training budget\n        -   HR may have a training budget for DEI training\n        -   an ERG (employee resource group) may have its own budget\n        -   Individuals may have their own training budget\n    -   Any of these can potentially ask for more budget if it‚Äôs motivated enough (and not every buyer realizes this power)\n\n### Price Factors\n\nI don‚Äôt always share the nuances of how I calculate price with customers, but some are curious.\n\nSome things that increase price:\n\n-   my expertise in something\n    -   could be that I‚Äôve done it before\n    -   could be that I can do it well anyway\n-   more client-hours\n-   more audience members (for talks/workshops)\n-   custom work (my expertise + more non-client-hours)\n    -   outcome is more important than polish overall\n-   more non-client-hours (prep work; research; writing/documenting)\n-   Intellectual Property ‚Äî agree to let them record it (they can own the performance, but not my content)\n\nSome things that decrease price:\n\n-   bulk discounts (more services / more people included in services)\n-   guaranteed testimonials (but you can get testimonials anyway!)\n-   guaranteed feedback from them (but you can get feedback anyway!)\n-   agree to recommend me to colleagues\n-   association ‚Äî agree to let me reference your company\n-   agree to let me share anonymized content?\n\nSome things that don‚Äôt affect price\n\n-   existing content (my expertise + it‚Äôs polished content)\n    -   good for me that I can re-use it! That doesn‚Äôt affect them though\n\n### 5 C‚Äôs of Compensation\n\nAndrea‚Äôs 5 C‚Äôs\n\n-   Explicit\n    -   Cash\n    -   Connections ‚Äî can they introduce me to new people? do they have a robust network?\n        -   ‚Äúintroduce me to 3 CTOs‚Äù\n    -   Content ‚Äî Is it public? Is it recorded ‚Äî can I put it on a speaker reel? Is this a talk I want to develop? Beta testing it. Ask for feedback? Can I re-use this work?\n-   Implicit\n    -   Credibility ‚Äî prestige of association\n    -   Community ‚Äî pro bono, doing good stuff want to help, meaning and impact\n\nExamples\n\n-   talk given before ‚Äî just cash\n-   Me EIT volunteering ‚Äî community support, credibility of cofounder of the group, connections to leads, content development ‚Äî not volunteering bc I get 4/5 of the C‚Äôs\n\nIf they‚Äôre low on cash\n\n-   Would I feel good doing this anyway? (community impact)\n-   Would it be recorded and I own the performance?\n-   Can this person introduce me to people?\n-   If org agrees to (buy in bulk) to bring me in for others ‚Äî I‚Äôll toss this in for free\n    -   eg ‚Äúif you commit to 5 I‚Äôll do a 2nd free one‚Äù\n    -   could be for women‚Äôs group but open to anyone\n-   Public community event, hosted/sponsored by company (advertising/marketing budget)\n\n### the power of discounts\n\nminor discounts incentivize choices - when they‚Äôre on the fence (often!) people tend to go for the discount\n\nbulk discounts - buy 10 sessions, get a discount % on them\n\nupsell discounts - buy service x, and get some of service y too\n\n\n### Pricing Techniques\n\nI don‚Äôt have an easy answer, but I have an approach you might like to use here! ‚ÄúRacheting‚Äù\n\n## Racheting\nI HAVE set my cost too high before and lots clients by following the common advice ‚Äúcharge more.‚Äù Usually I‚Äôd rather have these clients for sure for now and build out my portfolio and references and network ‚Äî and getting to my goal price is a secondary goal.I call this technique ‚Äúratcheting,‚Äù like the tool that tightens in one direction.Ratcheting is basically raising my price for each client so I can learn the boundaries. My goal price is in the range (‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù) between ‚Äúclient hesitates but does pay‚Äù and ‚Äúclient declines.‚Äù (sometimes I can turn a decline around somehow, but that‚Äôs a different story).I ‚Äúratchet‚Äù up the price until I have a sense of where the upper limit is for a certain type of client. This upper limit varies by industry, by size of company etc ‚Äî I try to keep those factors in mind too.\n\nIf you‚Äôre starting out with a new service or new type of client you could ‚Äúbootstrap‚Äù this search in the price-space by trying out different rates with different clients and seeing reactions ‚Äî like 200/h, 250/h, 300/h, 350/h etc.\n\nThis is searching the space of what they‚Äôll pay, as opposed to what you would like to get¬†paid. It‚Äôs totally useful to know what you want to get paid too! But it doesn‚Äôt necessarily inform you of what clients will pay\n\n## Rule of Thumb\nI‚Äôve heard a rule of thumb that a freelancer rate is in the ballpark of some number multiplied by your base rate ‚Äî x2 seems low to me, maybe it was x2.5 or x3 even?\n\nAlthough I think that piece of advice is really to shift your mindset more than an actual ‚Äúbased-on-data what-people-will-pay‚Äù sort of thing.\n\n## Commodity vs Specialty\nAnother big difference in pricing is if you‚Äôre doing a ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù service (easy to find an alternative) or a ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù service (hard/impossible to find an equivalent alternative). Specialty services can charge a lot more than commodity services. Specialization is powerful, and a lot of advice focuses on that -- but that doesn‚Äôt mean that offering a commodity service isn‚Äôt a valid option. Most services are probably more of a commodity!\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-20T01:48:52.425965061Z","tags":null},"/Tools":{"title":"Tools","content":"\nNotion, Quickbooks, Google Business, Stripe Invoicing, Stripe Atlas, Mercury Bank, Obsidian, Reclaim.ai, Calendly, Mailtrack.io, Whereby, Teachable, Gumroad, Etsy, Printful, Namecheap, super.so, webflow, Lu.ma,¬†[ko-fi.com](http://ko-fi.com/), Google Analytics, Hotjar, Affinity Designer, Descript\n\n  \n\nI use Notion (it‚Äôs like Google docs + a database) to track time worked and to track leads/deals, and to track individuals (like a CRM)\n\nI use Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed to track expenses and taxes\n\nI use Google for Business for my business email and Google docs\n\nI use Stripe Invoicing to send [invoices](Invoicing%20Clients.md) (usually locked down to ACH only, so I don‚Äôt lose a ton on credit card fees - and half my clients send e-checks anyway and that‚Äôs fine too)\n[Invoicing Clients](Invoicing%20Clients.md)\n\nI registered my business with Stripe Atlas - I was in a big hurry so I‚Äôm thankful for it.
