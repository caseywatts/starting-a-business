### pricing

per hour vs value-based

you can do per-hour to get started

The most common advice lately is to focus on value-based pricing — how much is the customer willing to pay to get the benefit?

### Who sets the price?

I like to ask “do you have a budget for this?” Then there are two ways:

1.  If your group has a set budget already, I can tailor things I offer to fit that budget.
    
2.  If your group doesn't have a budget, then I can calculate price on my end. To calculate it, I need to know what we'd want to do ideally — we can talk through that together!
    

### Relative Importance of Cost/Budget

Not every client is equally concerned about budget

-   Two big factors are
    -   impact (can you do the work you promise? will it have the effect we want?)
    -   budget (how much will it cost?)
-   Size of company
    -   Companies tend to be less concerned about cost than individuals (my money vs someone else’s money)
    -   Larger companies tend to be less concerned about cost (more about: can I justify it to the right people?)
-   Individual motivations
    -   What motivates [this specific person who will decide to buy or not]?
        -   Motivated more by impact than cost savings? They may be seen as the person who brought in the help to solve this big problem!
        -   Motivated more by cost savings than impact? They may just have to “cover their bases” — may be more focused on the highest value (impact divided by cost).
-   Multiple Budgets
    -   Many departments have their own budget — like:
        -   Each Engineering Manager may have a training budget
        -   HR may have a training budget for DEI training
        -   an ERG (employee resource group) may have its own budget
        -   Individuals may have their own training budget
    -   Any of these can potentially ask for more budget if it’s motivated enough (and not every buyer realizes this power)

### Price Factors

I don’t always share the nuances of how I calculate price with customers, but some are curious.

Some things that increase price:

-   my expertise in something
    -   could be that I’ve done it before
    -   could be that I can do it well anyway
-   more client-hours
-   more audience members (for talks/workshops)
-   custom work (my expertise + more non-client-hours)
    -   outcome is more important than polish overall
-   more non-client-hours (prep work; research; writing/documenting)
-   Intellectual Property — agree to let them record it (they can own the performance, but not my content)

Some things that decrease price:

-   bulk discounts (more services / more people included in services)
-   guaranteed testimonials (but you can get testimonials anyway!)
-   guaranteed feedback from them (but you can get feedback anyway!)
-   agree to recommend me to colleagues
-   association — agree to let me reference your company
-   agree to let me share anonymized content?

Some things that don’t affect price

-   existing content (my expertise + it’s polished content)
    -   good for me that I can re-use it! That doesn’t affect them though

### 5 C’s of Compensation

Andrea’s 5 C’s

-   Explicit
    -   Cash
    -   Connections — can they introduce me to new people? do they have a robust network?
        -   “introduce me to 3 CTOs”
    -   Content — Is it public? Is it recorded — can I put it on a speaker reel? Is this a talk I want to develop? Beta testing it. Ask for feedback? Can I re-use this work?
-   Implicit
    -   Credibility — prestige of association
    -   Community — pro bono, doing good stuff want to help, meaning and impact

Examples

-   talk given before — just cash
-   Me EIT volunteering — community support, credibility of cofounder of the group, connections to leads, content development — not volunteering bc I get 4/5 of the C’s

If they’re low on cash

-   Would I feel good doing this anyway? (community impact)
-   Would it be recorded and I own the performance?
-   Can this person introduce me to people?
-   If org agrees to (buy in bulk) to bring me in for others — I’ll toss this in for free
    -   eg “if you commit to 5 I’ll do a 2nd free one”
    -   could be for women’s group but open to anyone
-   Public community event, hosted/sponsored by company (advertising/marketing budget)

### the power of discounts

minor discounts incentivize choices - when they’re on the fence (often!) people tend to go for the discount

bulk discounts - buy 10 sessions, get a discount % on them

upsell discounts - buy service x, and get some of service y too


### Pricing Techniques

I don’t have an easy answer, but I have an approach you might like to use here! “Racheting”

## Racheting
I HAVE set my cost too high before and lots clients by following the common advice “charge more.” Usually I’d rather have these clients for sure for now and build out my portfolio and references and network — and getting to my goal price is a secondary goal.I call this technique “ratcheting,” like the tool that tightens in one direction.Ratcheting is basically raising my price for each client so I can learn the boundaries. My goal price is in the range (“sweet spot”) between “client hesitates but does pay” and “client declines.” (sometimes I can turn a decline around somehow, but that’s a different story).I “ratchet” up the price until I have a sense of where the upper limit is for a certain type of client. This upper limit varies by industry, by size of company etc — I try to keep those factors in mind too.

If you’re starting out with a new service or new type of client you could “bootstrap” this search in the price-space by trying out different rates with different clients and seeing reactions — like 200/h, 250/h, 300/h, 350/h etc.

This is searching the space of what they’ll pay, as opposed to what you would like to get paid. It’s totally useful to know what you want to get paid too! But it doesn’t necessarily inform you of what clients will pay

## Rule of Thumb
I’ve heard a rule of thumb that a freelancer rate is in the ballpark of some number multiplied by your base rate — x2 seems low to me, maybe it was x2.5 or x3 even?

Although I think that piece of advice is really to shift your mindset more than an actual “based-on-data what-people-will-pay” sort of thing.

## Commodity vs Specialty
Another big difference in pricing is if you’re doing a “commodity” service (easy to find an alternative) or a “specialty” service (hard/impossible to find an equivalent alternative). Specialty services can charge a lot more than commodity services. Specialization is powerful, and a lot of advice focuses on that -- but that doesn’t mean that offering a commodity service isn’t a valid option. Most services are probably more of a commodity!
