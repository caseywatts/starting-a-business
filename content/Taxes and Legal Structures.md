title: "Legal Structures and Taxes"

---

My favorite place to learn more about these is [the YouTube channel "All Up In Yo' Business with Attorney Aiden Durham"](https://www.youtube.com/@allupinyobiz)

Any of these less-formal sources will cite and reference all of the legal sources (IRS.gov etc) -- it just really helps to have things organized in terms of what YOU are wondering / looking into in the moment (which irs.gov does NOT do so well lol)


### Legal/Organizational Structures

todo: Differences between Sole Proprietorship, LLC, S-Corp etc

### Filing Taxes + Deductions

I use Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed to track expenses and manage my quarterly tax payments

I use CreditKarma Tax (free) to file taxes each year

You must pay taxes throughout the year.
* For traditionally-employed people, the company usually does deductions from your paycheck.
* For self-employed people, you have to file [quarterly estimated taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes).

What are these taxes? [Self-employment taxes and medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes) --
* ~15% self-employment + ~15% medicare ends up being close to the ~30% that you're probably used to (of coures it varies by income level, but)

#### How do I remember to pay quarterly taxes? When do I pay them?
Make a recurring calendar event! 
The dates are listed here:
https://www.irs.gov/payments/pay-as-you-go-so-you-wont-owe-a-guide-to-withholding-estimated-taxes-and-ways-to-avoid-the-estimated-tax-penalty
As of 2023 they are:
- April 15
- June 15
- September 15
- January 15

Most people pay either:
* Online: https://www.irs.gov/payments
* By Mail: mailing in a check (Quickbooks will generate a stub for you)

### How do I calculate my estimated taxes?
What if I don't know how much I'll make this year??

To calculate my estimated taxes, I just pay whatever Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed tells me to pay.

### Deductions

Deductions for business equipment (laptops etc) and software and travel and food etc happens on the [1040 Section C](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sc.pdf).

Quickbooks Self-Employed is how I keep track of these -- it knows the IRS's ~20 categories AND a bunch of common ones that go into "other", and it can generate the table of amounts you'll need for the Schedule C come tax time.

There is also this other deduction QBIR: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/qualified-business-income-deduction
