title: "Invoicing Clients"

---

I bill them as a sole proprietor, and money goes directly to my personal bank account (through Stripe’s intermediary one if they do ACH).

I send an Invoice (via Stripe) — it can be as simple as an email, although I like them to be PDF at least like Stripe does

Then they pay Stripe’s ACH or they send me a check

I deposit it in my personal account

Before invoicing them I usually get them to sign a contract (MSA/SOW) with rates

Sometimes I skip a contract if it’s small and/or I trust them — like my one off coaching clients who pay upfront anyway)

Some companies also ask for my SSN/EIN so they can give me a W-9 at the end of the year (but it doesn’t matter to me if they do). I’ve been using SSN for the past two years since I didn’t get set up with an EIN until this LLC (and that’s okay!) If a company doesn’t deal with W-9 that’s okay and I’m still responsible for taxes on it (Quickbooks tracks this income) — I don’t really care if they deal with it or not personally
