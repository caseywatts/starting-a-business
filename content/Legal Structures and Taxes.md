### Legal/Organizational Structures

Differences between Sole Proprietorship, LLC, S-Corp etc

### Filing Taxes + Deductions

I use Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed to track expenses and manage my quarterly tax payments

I use CreditKarma Tax (free) to file taxes each year

You must pay taxes throughout the year.
* For traditionally-employed people, the company usually does deductions from your paycheck.
* For self-employed people, you have to file [quarterly estimated taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes).

What are these taxes? [Self-employment taxes and medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes) --
* ~15% self-employment + ~15% medicare ends up being close to the ~30% that you're probably used to (of coures it varies by income level, but)

#### How do I remember to pay quarterly taxes? When do I pay them?
Make a recurring calendar event! 
The dates are listed here:

Most people pay either:

* By Mail: mailing in a check (Quickbooks will generate a stub for you)

### How do I calculate my estimated taxes?
What if I don't know how much I'll make this year??

To calculate my estimated taxes, I just pay whatever Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed tells me to pay.
