Notion, Quickbooks, Google Business, Stripe Invoicing, Stripe Atlas, Mercury Bank, Obsidian, Reclaim.ai, Calendly, Mailtrack.io, Whereby, Teachable, Gumroad, Etsy, Printful, Namecheap, super.so, webflow, Lu.ma, [ko-fi.com](http://ko-fi.com/), Google Analytics, Hotjar, Affinity Designer, Descript

  

I use Notion (it’s like Google docs + a database) to track time worked and to track leads/deals, and to track individuals (like a CRM)

I use Intuit Quickbooks Self-Employed to track expenses and taxes

I use Google for Business for my business email and Google docs

I use Stripe Invoicing to send [invoices](Invoicing%20Clients.md) (usually locked down to ACH only, so I don’t lose a ton on credit card fees - and half my clients send e-checks anyway and that’s fine too)
[Invoicing Clients](Invoicing%20Clients.md)

I registered my business with Stripe Atlas - I was in a big hurry so I’m thankful for it. I’d probably register directly with the state even though it’s more work if I wasn’t in a hurry. I’m still working as a sole proprietorship lately, I haven’t billed anyone as my LLC yet.

I use Mercury bank for my business bank account

I don’t have business insurance yet but I plan to eventually

I use Obsidian to take notes lately and keep a daily log

I use Reclaim.ai to sync my several work calendars 

I use Calendly to have appointment slots open for people to schedule time with me

I use Mailtrack.io to track email opens (it even works on mobile as a gmail plugin too! That’s a big feature to me)

I use Whereby for video calls with better breakout rooms, for workshops

I use Teachable (soon hopefully!) for selling online courses

I use Gumroad to sell digital things (my ebook/audiobook)

I use Etsy to sell physical things, wired up to Printful.com to print/ship them

I use Namecheap to buy/manage web domains

I use super.so to host my Happy and Effective website (it styles some Notion pages, so I can edit content in Notion)

I use webflow to host my book website [debuggingyourbrain.com](http://debuggingyourbrain.com/) (all custom designed)

I use Lu.ma to host events (a free Eventbrite alternative)

I use [ko-fi.com](http://ko-fi.com/) to accept donations (like after a free workshop)

I use Google Analytics to track website traffic

I use Hotjar to record website browsing behavior (scrolling, mouse, etc)

I use Affinity Designer to design web graphics for events and visuals for blog posts etc (it’s like Illustrator but not Adobe and not subscription based)

I use Descript to edit videos and make subtitles and audiograms for videos

I draft contracts in Google Docs, and do “Save as PDF” (to retain the doc title — much better than cmd+P)

I get signatures using HelloSign (and they can sign it on their phone even with a finger-squiggle)
