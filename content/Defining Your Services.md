title: "Defining Your Services"

---

Your first year you might "try on" a lot of services -- learning which things there is "market appetite" for, and which things you like to do. My first year I had ~30 services that I offered or got paid to do, or was considered for. It's dizzying to try and do too many, but I learned a lot about the market and about myself!

Eventually most people decide to offer fewer services to specialize in. This helps you with your own focus, but it has an even stronger effect for marketing. The more specific your services are, the easier it is for people to think of you when your services are needed -- and this includes  both potential clients directly and people who would connect you to those potential clients.

As my friend Andrea Goulet often says, "the riches are in the niches" (riches rhymes with niches if you force it! hah).

### Starter Service

-   Most places want to ‘try it before the buy it”
    -   or more often try it (paid) before they buy a lot of it
    -   this reduces the risk of buying a big expensive service
-   What services can you over a small amount of that helps them see the value of more?
    -   For me, workshops: a free workshop (granted to someone who attends a public workshop of mine, to take to their company)
    -   For me, coaching: Coaching comes up in some way when I interview people through an Organizational Assessment — people who would want coaching often volunteer for this. I’m not explicitly coaching in these, but they can see my style, how I listen and validate and have insight (which I don’t take up too much time to share yet bc I’m busy listening first!)
