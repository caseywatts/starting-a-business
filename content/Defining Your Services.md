title: "Defining Your Services"

---

After you define your services, you'll likely need: [Pricing Your Services](Pricing%20Your%20Services.md)

Your first year you might "try on" a lot of services -- learning which things there is "market appetite" for, and which things you like to do. My first year I had ~30 services that I offered or got paid to do, or was considered for. It's dizzying to try and do too many, but I learned a lot about the market and about myself!

Eventually most people decide to offer fewer services to specialize in. This helps you with your own focus, but it has an even stronger effect for marketing. The more specific your services are, the easier it is for people to think of you when your services are needed -- and this includes  both potential clients directly and people who would connect you to those potential clients.

As my friend Andrea Goulet often says, "the riches are in the niches" (riches can rhyme with niches if you want it to! hah).

### Starter Service

-   Most places want to ‘try it before the buy it”
    -   or more often try it (paid) before they buy a lot of it
    -   this reduces the risk of buying a big expensive service
-   What services can you over a small amount of that helps them see the value of more?
    -   For me, workshops: a free workshop (granted to someone who attends a public workshop of mine, to take to their company)
    -   For me, coaching: Coaching comes up in some way when I interview people through an Organizational Assessment — people who would want coaching often volunteer for this. I’m not explicitly coaching in these, but they can see my style, how I listen and validate and have insight (which I don’t take up too much time to share yet bc I’m busy listening first!)

## Too Many Options? Narrowing It Down
If someone asks "so what do you do?" do you have a short answer for it?

Lately I've been answering that with my top 3 services that I want to do more of
![](Pasted%20image%2020230130173345.png)

How did I come up with these three?
1. I had a list of ~20 services that I had done or been asked to do or wanted to do.
2. I decide what factors make me want to do some more than others (lots!)
	* Uniqueness/differentiator
	* Clients' perceived value
	* Impact
	* Request Frequency
	* Average Engagement Value ($)
	* Length of Engagement / Renewability
	* Leads to More Business
	* Service Maturity
	* Easy Effort
3. After [scoring these options](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4SpTeewBSk2GBBLiSn9e3pukifmMUSAZIUIeeO0tD0/edit?usp=sharing) , a few rose to the top!
