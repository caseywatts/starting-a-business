### For someone to buy your service, they go through phases

AIDA

Aware = Are they aware of your service?

Interest = Are they interested? (do they have the problem?)

Desire = Do they desire this solution? (this solution?)

Action = Have they paid and showed up for it?

### Sales Funnel

A potential client could fall off at any phase - some % per phase

Sales funnel spreadsheet example - it’s numbers!

To get enough clients, it’s a numbers game

### Who is your target audience? Where are they?

For tech employees as an example

Social media: Often on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Online communities: Slack/Discord

In person events: They’re also at [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) events and conferences!

### How to get people into the funnel?

You don’t have to use all of these, choose your strengths:

social media

referrals

networking

events

etc

### Connections

Most people start with connections!

-   your connections hiring you directly
-   your connections’ companies hiring you
-   your connections’ connections hiring you
-   your connections’ connections’ companies hiring you

### How to get people through the funnel?

Once you have a “lead”

Sales call techniques - listening, SPIN selling

people are immensely more likely to buy something to meet an explicit need they have - one they express explicitly

### Getting Started Is Tough

What can you say when someone ask “who have you worked with?” but you’re just getting started?? 😬

usually what they really want to know is “why should I believe you can do this?”.

sometimes they mean “what sectors have you worked in? my sector is not like the others!” (like: private companies, government, consulting firms, nonprofits etc)

### Credibility

Eventually you can say “I have been paid to do this through my own company, here are past clients”

In the meantime it’s okay to list places you’ve done related work with, even if it was before the inception of this company. You _do_ have a lot of experience, and it counts!

you probably have past _experience_ you can leverage.

### What if they find out I’m an imposter?

If you got the client, how confident are you that you could help with their problems?

Think of people you’ve worked with who you were not impressed with — you’re probably even above average! If you’re just starting, you care a lot and have a lot to prove. I’m confident in you, even if I don’t know you.

Sometimes my partner shares a horror story from a past company, and I love the way he punctuates them — he says “anyone can run a business!”

That’s... true! You can, too :)

### I want some initial clients

If not, or if you want more, you could do a client or two for cheaper or free. You could volunteer for a nonprofit in exchange for using them as case studies you share.

Beware not to let this trend continue for long though — you need less credibility like this than you might imagine. A lot of your success depends on your sales techniques.

## Lead Generation

I love doing public, free, community events anyway - I’ve been doing these for 10y!

These also happen to generate business leads for me lately. Event hosts are very generous at encouraging me to share my business materials, even when I’m shy to — they want quality content, and I’m a professional at that!

### building credibility

if you can — show, don’t tell

do invest in people who “get it” already — strong allies

### Trust

highest = own experience

next = experience of someone trusted (friend, coworker)

next = experience of someone kinda trusted (respected companies; certifications)

next = experience of someone not trusted (strangers on the internet)

lowest = what the salesperson says themselves

### Why connections are so powerful

friends, past coworkers, professional contacts

they have the highest level of trust (their own, direct experience)

they often have the 2nd level of trust (someone trusted) for a decision maker

### Competitive Analysis — How is the customer making their decisions?

What 3-6 factors are they considering? Which are more/less important? You can ask them that!

What factors are the most important? How would they rank them?

When someone is comfortable thinking in numbers, sometimes I ask them to say “double or half (or average)” for each of them.

Knowing this can help you know what to focus on with them

This can also help you decide how to strengthen your company and/or marketing materials, too!

### Questions are more powerful than statements

“From what you’ve seen, what would you say the strengths are of my company?”

“I’m stronger than competitors because REASONS”

### Weaknesses

I’m not sure about asking about weaknesses/concerns/hesitations directly — could move their focus somewhere you don’t want them to focus

but it’s probably good to address any glaring ones upfront, or be ready to address them
