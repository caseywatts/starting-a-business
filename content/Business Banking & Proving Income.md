If you are a single-person business (sole proprietor or single-member LLC), you don't have to have an EIN (Employer Identification Number) or business bank account. But it can help some!

## A True Business Bank Account
A business bank account is one registered to an EIN (Employer Identification Number). For example, I have a business account with Mercury for my company "Happy and Effective LLC" which has its own EIN.

Before I had my EIN I could NOT open a business bank account with Mercury (or any other bank) -- there was no formal business entity for the account to be owned by yet.

## A Pseudo-Business Bank Account
You can create a pseudo-business bank account by having a separate checking account in your main bank, just to help keep things straight for tax time.

When I was getting started, I just used a separate checking account "bucket" for my business money. In Ally (my personal bank) I nicknamed one account “Personal Checking” and one “Business Checking.”

This helped me keep income and expenses straight, like in Mint and Quickbooks. Quickbooks will even auto-tag things for certain accounts.

Before my business bank account was set up, I also set aside one of my personal credit cards to be used for business-only, to help with tracking expenses (in Quickbooks).

You can even set up regular transfers $x/month to simulate a "paycheck" for yourself.

## Proving Income
The downside of pseudo-business bank accounts is that it's harder to prove "income" with these self-to-self transfers.

People doing income verification (for renting, or buying a house, or taking out a loan for a car etc) expect to see transfers from a true business bank account to your personal account.

It's still possible to prove income without a business bank account! I'm still glad I didn't deal with the overhead of a business for a year or two, personally. 

I've managed to prove my income to rent a place by showing my bank statements with my clients' payments to me (those are from a business bank account! not just transfers from-me-to-me).

I also added a spreadsheet to help make it clear (not sure if they read it really!).



I don’t think there’s too much benefit to using an entirely separate bank for the sole proprietorship account - I just use the same one (Ally). Maybe you can find better rates or something but I never looked into that part.
