title: "Formal Paperwork"

## Do we need formal paperwork?
I usually (80% of the time) get clients to sign a contract (MSA/SOW) with rates and all. It's best practice to set expectations clearly like this, especially for larger clients and longer engagements.

Sometimes I do skip a full contract! Like for one-off coaching clients who pay upfront for 3 sessions. In these cases expecttaions were still set pretty clearly! Booth in an onboarding doc and in a 15-min screening call.

I try to do SOWs even for small things (an SOW is very short anyway! see below), but sometimes I might skip an SOW if it's a small amount of money and I already trust them (i.e. they've paid me on time before) -- like a 3-hour thing to help a past client.

Some people might say that's bad practice, but it's always worked out for me so far when there's trust, and I only do it if I'm willing to eat the cost if things go wrong, too.

## Types of Formal Documents
Proposal
MSA
SOW
Invoice


# Marketing / Sales

## Untargeted marketing

website

## Individual-targeted marketing

email to (the decision maker at the company for your service; eg the CTO or the HR training person) with what they might need

## "Pre-posal"

“here’s what you said you need”

“here’s what makes me uniquely equipped to help”

“here’s how I can help”

emailed + attached

## Proposal

similar to the pre-posal, but with prices?

(idk why Andrea doesn’t call the pre-posal a proposal, all the clients seem to lol)

# Expectation Setting / Legal

## Expectations for Relationship

MSA Contract — contains late payment details etc

## Expectations for Current Work

SOW Contract

First SOW gets sent out with the MSA, same doc

# Money Terms

## Estimate

ballpark amount, pending info about detail

could be a range

e.g. “It depends on the size of your org, or whether I do surveys”

could be in the Pre-posal/Proposal

## Quote

specific amount that won’t change for this specific, defined work

scope changes could trigger a change still of course

could be a fixed amount, or could be a rate

could be in the Pre-posal/Proposal

## Invoice

= bill; you owe me this much today, a specific amount

one SOW could have multiple invoices (e.g. if it’s monthly)

should be attached to a SOW (current work expectations doc)

# Examples

## Brian’s Design Work

-   Marketing Artifacts
    -   Introduction = existing relationship; no need for the marketing artifacts
    -   Agreement = requested something by email; reply with yes I can help
-   Expectation Setting Artifacts
    -   Relationship Expectations = implied
    -   Current Work Expectations = by email / implied
-   Payment Artifacts
    -   Expectation Setting = Quote
    -   Billing = Invoice

## Casey’s Usual Flow

-   Marketing Artifacts
    -   Introduction: opening with the targeted marketing to HR etc; linking to the website
    -   Agreement: Pre-posal “here’s what you said you need”
-   Expectation Setting Artifacts
    -   Relationship Expectations = MSA
    -   Current Work Expectations = SOW
-   Payment Artifacts
    -   Expectation Setting = Estimate in pre-posal
    -   Billing = Invoice, paid upfront, tied to SOW


## After Formal Paperwork
After we agree to the formal paperwork, you can work on [Getting Paid + Invoicing](Getting%20Paid%20+%20Invoicing.md)
