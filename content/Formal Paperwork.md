Proposal
MSA
SOW
Invoice


# Marketing / Sales

## Untargeted marketing

website

## Individual-targeted marketing

email to (the decision maker at the company for your service; eg the CTO or the HR training person) with what they might need

## "Pre-posal"

“here’s what you said you need”

“here’s what makes me uniquely equipped to help”

“here’s how I can help”

emailed + attached

## Proposal

similar to the pre-posal, but with prices?

(idk why Andrea doesn’t call the pre-posal a proposal, all the clients seem to lol)

# Expectation Setting / Legal

## Expectations for Relationship

MSA Contract — contains late payment details etc

## Expectations for Current Work

SOW Contract

First SOW gets sent out with the MSA, same doc

# Money Terms

## Estimate

ballpark amount, pending info about detail

could be a range

e.g. “It depends on the size of your org, or whether I do surveys”

could be in the Pre-posal/Proposal

## Quote

specific amount that won’t change for this specific, defined work

scope changes could trigger a change still of course

could be a fixed amount, or could be a rate

could be in the Pre-posal/Proposal

## Invoice

= bill; you owe me this much today, a specific amount

one SOW could have multiple invoices (e.g. if it’s monthly)

should be attached to a SOW (current work expectations doc)

# Examples

## Brian’s Design Work

-   Marketing Artifacts
    -   Introduction = existing relationship; no need for the marketing artifacts
    -   Agreement = requested something by email; reply with yes I can help
-   Expectation Setting Artifacts
    -   Relationship Expectations = implied
    -   Current Work Expectations = by email / implied
-   Payment Artifacts
    -   Expectation Setting = Quote
    -   Billing = Invoice

## Casey’s Usual Flow

-   Marketing Artifacts
    -   Introduction: opening with the targeted marketing to HR etc; linking to the website
    -   Agreement: Pre-posal “here’s what you said you need”
-   Expectation Setting Artifacts
    -   Relationship Expectations = MSA
    -   Current Work Expectations = SOW
-   Payment Artifacts
    -   Expectation Setting = Estimate in pre-posal
    -   Billing = Invoice, paid upfront, tied to SOW
