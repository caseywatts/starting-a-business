For the first two years I would bill clients as a sole proprietor, and money goes directly to my personal bank account. Lately I'm working on billing them as my LLC, and it'll go to my business bank account (Mercury) and THEN I'll eventually "pay myself" by transferring it to my personal account (no paystubs or anything).

## Before Invoicing
Before invoicing a client I usually do the [Formal Paperwork](Formal%20Paperwork.md)  -- MSA, SOW, agree to rates.

## Invoice
An invoice can be as simple as an email. I like them to be a PDF at least with some basic formatting (but it's not required).

Note: If you do this in Google Docs, don't do `cmd+p` to print, instead do `File → Export to → PDF` -- that'll have the correct title!

I use Stripe to send Invoices lately. It generates a PDF for me. They only get a cut if the client uses credit card (I usually turn that off -- most big clients pay by ACH/Check anyway)

## Sharing SSN/EIN with the company
Some companies also ask for my SSN/EIN so they can give me a W-9 at the end of the year (but it doesn’t matter to me if they do). I’ve been using SSN for the past two years since I didn’t get set up with an EIN until this LLC (and that’s okay!)

If a company doesn’t deal with W-9 that’s okay and I’m still responsible for taxes on it (Quickbooks tracks this income) — I don’t really care if they deal with it or not, personally.

## Invoice Payment
They might pay me in one of several ways:
1. ACH. Often they pay via the Stripe invoice (ACH)
2. Check. Sometimes they send me a check (by mail or digitally and I have to print it), and then I deposit it manually.
3. Third-party. sometimes they pay online another way (bill.com, and I have it connected to my bank account)

I don't have to worry about this upfront -- I just send them the invoice, and they come back and ask "can I pay you using X?" and I usually just say yes to whatever it is.  

## Payment Link / Sliding Scale
For some services (like [career coaching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qat3-ghzTQPWqIywitsfegXFcod_BNOlkLvNAYmb8O8/edit?usp=sharing)) I use a sliding scale + Stripe's payment link feature. I want to help people who need it, even if they are making less money. I can't let all of my clients be on the lower end, so I soft-cap it (just by tracking that in my head).

I do payments for these through Stripe using coupon codes (check out the doc to see how I do it).

For individuals paying me, I let them use credit card and I eat the fee (most individual people / non-businesses aren't used to paying ACH, and it's not wotrh it to me to teach them to do ti)

If someone wants a larger package of services (like 6+ sessions), then I'll usually invoice them instead (like above), as opposed to using Stripe payment link.

(Stripe payments + coupon codes IS multiple steps though, and I wish I could simplify it for clients -- someday!)

I bill them as a sole proprietor, and money goes directly to my personal bank account (through Stripe’s intermediary one if they do ACH).

I send an Invoice (via Stripe) — it can be as simple as an email, although I like them to be PDF at least like Stripe does

Then they pay Stripe’s ACH or they send me a check

I deposit it in my personal account

Before invoicing them I usually get them to sign a contract (MSA/SOW) with rates

Sometimes I skip a contract if it’s small and/or I trust them — like my one off coaching clients who pay upfront anyway)
